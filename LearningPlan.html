    <h2>Learning Plan</h1>
    <p>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p> 
    <p>
      To use my coding experience, business degree and veterinary nursing knowledge within the animal welfare industry.
    </p>
    <p>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
    <p>
      My strengths are I am hard working and resilient. My limitations are my confidence (imposter syndrome) and my stress levels. I do tend to compare myself to others as well.
      </p>
      <p>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
  <p>More experience talking to strangers online, I definitely am mostly use to face to face interactions with people and it can be quite intimidating messaging a large amount of people.</p>
<p>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you and An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>    
<p>
I am a big fan of routines so have planned one out to follow during this course which I am excited about
I do need to reach out more often, especially when it is starting to feel overwhelming. I need to remind myself that most people here are beginners like myself. I also need to remind myself that I won’t be able to remember and do everything all at once.
</p>
<p>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
<p>When I have been stuck on something for more than half an hour, or when I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and just need some guidance.
 </p>
  <p>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
<p>I am hoping to find support and understanding.</p>
<p>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p>
<p>I have no commitments at this stage except for before and after 8.30-5.30.</p>
