  <h3>Identity, Values and Strengths</h3>
  <p style="font-size: smaller;">
    <p>1.	Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</p>

    <p>2.	Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</p>
    <p>
      I surround myself with ambitious people which has really helped me put myself out there and helped me realise that I am capable of achieving anything I set my mind to. I also surround myself with very compassionate and empathetic people as mental health is so important to keep on top of.
    </p>
    <p>3.	Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</p>
    <p>
      I am very resilient and hardworking which will hopefully translate in the quality of the work that I am able to accomplish in  this course. I am also very compassionate and empathetic and a people person which will allow me to reach out to my fellow cohorts. 
    </p>
    <p>4.	Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</p>
 <p>I can be very hard on myself and I can struggle with my confidence when I start something new. I also compare myself far too much to others. This has been affecting me as I experience large bouts of imposter syndrome which will hopefully become lesser as long as I am nicer to myself and reach out often.</p>
<p>5.	Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>  
<p>As an emergency veterinary nurse, tensions were always high. I tend to try to combat through light heartedness but it is definitely a difficult job to be in when the stakes are so high. I always encourage others to talk out their problems or have a breather when needed as well.</p>
