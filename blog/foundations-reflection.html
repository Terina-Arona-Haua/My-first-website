    <h3>1.  Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning</h3>
    <p>
      One new thing I have learnt about myself and my ego is my self-limiting beliefs.
      I did not realise how easily I would doubt myself in this programme and core learning, specifically neuroplasticity, helped me understand that I may potentially have a fixed mindset which is damaging but I am willing to work hard on changing it.
      The second new thing I learnt was how bad my ego-driven behaviours can be. 
      I was and am far too afraid to ask for help, I believe it is harder due to being online and I can't necessarily gauge how my fellow cohorts are doing, which I shouldn't do regardless but it is definitely easier to work on problems altogether in a class
      as everyone is more open and vulnerable. Core learning has helped me understand that this is a normal reaction for a lot of people and taught me ways to better manage them.
      The third thing I learnt is about my emotional triggers. 
      Quite similar to ego-driven behaviours but emotionally I was triggered quite often due to feeling as though I was struggling too much or simply not smart enough to understand the tech.
      Core learning has helped me come up with ways to better manage my emotional triggers.
  </p>
    <h3>2. The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming</h3>
    <p>
      Values, empathy, and self-awareness are important skills in learning and programming. 
      Values are the guiding principles that drive our decision-making processes and help us prioritise our actions. 
      Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, which is essential when working collaboratively with others. Self-awareness is the ability to understand ourselves, our emotions, and our thought processes. 
      By developing these skills, we can become better programmers who work well in teams, understand the needs of our users, and make ethical decisions.
   </p>
    <h3>3. What surprised me the most about the core learning</h3>
    <p>
      One of the surprising things about core learning is how relevant it is to programming. 
      Although programming is often associated with logic and technical skills, it also requires emotional intelligence and self-awareness to be successful. 
      Core learning helps students develop these skills, which are essential in the workplace.
    </p>
    <h3>4. The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>
    <p>
      Core learning can be challenging because it requires students to examine their beliefs and values, which can be uncomfortable. 
      It also requires students to be vulnerable and open to feedback, which can be difficult for most people.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Why programming schools are spending so much time focusing on core learning</h3>
    <p>
      Programming schools are focusing on core learning because they recognize that technical skills are not enough for success in the workplace. 
      Employers are looking for programmers who can work collaboratively with others, communicate effectively, and make ethical decisions. 
      Core learning helps students develop these skills, which are in high demand in the tech industry.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Is time spent studying core learning a waste of time</h3>
    <p>
      No, the time spent studying core learning is not a waste of time. 
      While programming skills are essential, core learning provides students with skills that are equally important in the workplace. 
      By developing values, empathy, and self-awareness, students can become better programmers who are more effective communicators, collaborators, and decision-makers.
