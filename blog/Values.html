  <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
  <div class="Paragraph">
    <h3>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
    </h3>
    <p>
 In my previous role as a veterinary nurse I had to make ethical decisions daily as they were required to provide the best possible care for animals.One instance was that we had a stray kitten that required immediate medical care. Once we provided medical care and hospitalisation, I ended up adopting her, she is the tortie kitten in my blog photo. Now living her best princess life.
    </p>
 <h3> 2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
 </h3>
 <p>
 I grew up in a culture that valued education and hard work which instilled a strong work ethic. I also surround myself with compassionate and ambitious people, both values that are important to me.
 </p>
 <h3> 3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
 </h3>
 <p>
 I am hard working, empathetic and quite sociable. Having a strong work ethic will help me in my journey as this course is very challenging and requires a lot of practice and persistence. Empathy and being sociable will also support my learning journey as collaboration is an extremely important part of coding and already possessing these human skills will be very beneficial to me.
  </p>
 <h3> 4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your mom and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
 </h3>
 <p>
 My limitations include being overly critical of myself, struggling with stress management and comparing myself. These can affect my learning journey in many ways. My critical mindset can be discouraging when I encounter a problem, reaching out more and being kinder to myself will help with this. Stress management through meditation and comparing myself less to my peers will also be beneficial.
 </p>
 <h3> Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
 </h3>
 <p>
 Resistance and tension will always occur when collaborating with others as there are always differences in opinions, conflicting priorities and personality clashes. Strategies that I have used that were effective were how I would always communicate openly and clearly and would always try to find if there were any underlying issues and address them as soon as possible. I found these work really well and I will continue to use them
