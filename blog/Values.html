  <div class="Paragraph">
    <h3>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
    </h3>
    <p>In my previous role as a veterinary nurse I had to make ethical decisions daily as they were required to provide the best possible care for animals. We had a couple bring in a kitten that was covered in glue and was in distress and required immediate medical care. I had to make an ethical decision on how to proceed with the kittens care. In this situation the ethical values that came into play included animal welfare, compassion and professional competence. We assessed the kitten and performed a physical examination and resulted in the kitten needing to be hospitalised. Once she was better we advertised that she was with us, in order to try and find her owners but nobody stepped forward. This decision aligned with our clinics ethical values and we worked together to provide the best medical care for her. I ended up adopting her, she is the tortie kitten in my blog photo. Now living her best princess life.
