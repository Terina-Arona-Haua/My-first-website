  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is being able to recognise and manage ones emotions. Through enhancing your emotional intelligence you will be able to positively relieve stress, empathise more easily with others, and better conquer any challenges that may  come your way. Emotional intelligence tends to be split into five core components which are empathy, social skills, self-awareness, self-regulation and motivation. Being able to empathise with others is a key trait in being a successful leader, as being an understanding manager enables more trust and respect within a team. Harbouring effective communication skills with others is also a key trait in being a successful leader as it can assist with cooperation between team members, conflict resolutions and social awareness. Self-awareness is the ability to recognise your own strengths and weaknesses which can allow you to not succumb to any emotions you may feel at any given time and instead be able to observe, think and then act. Self-regulation is possessing the ability to transform any negative emotions and thoughts into positive ones and to also combat any challenges with a productive mindset. Lastly self-motivation is extremely important, especially within leadership, as having an optimistic and driven manager will inherently boost team moral and loyalty.
