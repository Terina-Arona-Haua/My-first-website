        <p>My name is Terina Arona-Haua and this is my blog 
          documenting my journey with DevAcademy.
          I was born down south in Dunedin and moved to Auckland when I was around 12 years old and have lived here ever since! I was an emergency veterinary nurse but I am wanting to try my hand at a whole new challenge. I have three cats, Milo and Mei-Mei and Rusty (my parents catnapped her when they moved back down to Dunedin). I love animals, music, festivals, movies, gaming and the gym but am terrified of deep water and the ocean (or more so what lurks in it). I hope my DevAcademy journey has a happy ending!
