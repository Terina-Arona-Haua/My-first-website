        <p>My name is Terina Arona-Haua and this is my blog
          documenting my journey with Dev Academy!
  I was born in Dunedin and moved to Auckland when I was around 12 years old and have lived here ever since. Previously I was an emergency veterinary nurse but I am wanting to try my hand at a whole new challenge. I have three cats, Milo and Mei-Mei (on the beanbag) and Rusty (below, my parents catnapped her when they moved back down to Dunedin). I love animals, music and gaming and am terrified of deep water and the open ocean.
