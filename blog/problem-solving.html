    <h3>1. A time when I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
    <p>
    I was stuck on how to make my website accessible. 
    I was getting extremely frustrated and had googled ways to fix it and looked on freeCodeCamp and I had the answers but I was not implementing them properly.
    I decided that it was best to walk away and try again later in the day and when I came back refreshed I was able to fix my code relatively quickly.
    I learnt that it is definitely important to give yourself a break, especially when you are getting extremely frustrated with a problem.
    </p>
    <h3>2. A time when I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
    <p>
      A time when I elegantly solved a problem would be during Gradebook in Kata. 
      As I worked through the problems, I started to feel more and more confident. 
      Eventually, I was able to write a script that solved the problem elegantly and efficiently. 
      It was a great feeling of accomplishment, and I learned that breaking a problem down into smaller steps and trying different approaches can help make a difficult task more manageable.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Reflection on problem-solving techniques</h3>
    <p>
      Pseudocode is helpful for breaking down a problem into smaller steps and planning out a solution. I am confident with this technique as it allows me to stay focused on my overall aim.
      Trying something and using the rubber ducky method (where you explain the problem to an inanimate object) has helped me see my problem clearer as speaking outloud unjumbles my thoughts. 
      Reading error messages and console.logging has helped me identify issues in my code and is the technique I use most. 
      Googling has been a great way to find solutions to problems as there are so many different ways to tackle them. 
      Asking peers and facilitators for help is important when I am stuck as sometimes I just need a fresh perspective. 
      And finally, reflecting on my processes continuously will help me improve my problem-solving skills over time.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Reflection on reluctance to ask for help</h3>
    <p>
      There have been times when I've been reluctant to ask for help, mostly because I didn't want to seem like I didn't know what I was doing. 
      However, I've learned that asking for help is actually a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows that you're willing to admit when you don't know something and that you're open to learning from others. 
      I've also learned that seeking help early on can save a lot of time and frustration in the long run.
