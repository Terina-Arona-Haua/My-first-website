      Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of Māori health and is based on the metaphor of a wharenui.
      It consists of four interconnected walls, or dimensions, of health:
      Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing), Taha Wairua (spiritual well being), Taha Hinengaro (mental and emotional wellbeing), and Taha Whānau (family and social well being). 
      The model emphasises the importance of addressing and nurturing each of these in order to achieve overall wellbeing and balance.
