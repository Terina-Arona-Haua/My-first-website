    <h3>
      1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h3>
    <p>
     My long term career goal is to be working within the animal welfare industry in some way, to improve the laws surrounding animal welfare, within New Zealand.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      My strengths are that I am hard working and resilient. My limitations are that I can be quite critical of myself and I can find it hard to manage my stress.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
  <p>
 I definitely am mostly used to face to face interactions with people and it can be quite intimidating messaging a large amount of people, so becoming more comfortable with reaching out to others online is a skill I would like to develop whilst at Dev Academy.
  </p>
 <h3>
  4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you and An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
 </h3>   
 <p>
 I love routines and so I have planned one out to follow during this course.
 I do need to reach out more often, especially when it is starting to feel overwhelming. I need to remind myself that most people here are beginners like myself. I also need to remind myself that I won’t be able to remember and do everything all at once.
 </p>
 <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
 </h3>
 <p>
  When I have been stuck on something for more than half an hour, or when I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and just need some guidance, I will seek help.
 </p>
  <h3>
    6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
  </h3>
 <p>
 I am expecting clear communication, a supportive environment, a flexible and accommodating approach to teaching and adequate resources that will assist with my learning.
 </p>
 <h3>
  7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
 </h3>
 <p>I have no commitments at this stage except for before and after 8.30-5.30.
