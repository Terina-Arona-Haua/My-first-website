    <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3>
      1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The long term goal is to implement the skills I learn in coding into an animal welfare position in some way.
      </p>
      <h3>2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        My biggest strengths in the Bootcamp will definitely be my work ethic and how I can be very sociable which will hopefully translate well in partner based learning.
        My biggest weaknesses in the Bootcamp will be my critical thinking of myself and my ego-driven behaviours.
        I am hoping these will be easier to manage due to learning with everyone over zoom and the check ins with the Human Skills facilitators.
      </p>
      <h3>3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>
        My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be staying on top of all the material that we will be learning.
        I am worried about the volume that is being condensed into such a small time frame but hopefully everything will be fine!
      </p>
      <h3>4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>
        Human skills that I would like to see developed in myself are the abilities to communicate with a wide range of people, collaborate with others 
        regardless of their tech skills (more so with me not comparing too much or becoming embarrassed) and giving and receiving feedback.
      </p>
      <h3>5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
        My expectations from the Bootcamp team are that they continue to be supportive and responsive to my needs as a learner. 
        To continue to provide clear and timely communication, offer guidance and feedback on my work, and a safe and inclusive learning environment.
        Support to me means having access to resources and guidance when I need it. It also means having a clear understanding of expectations and objectives, and receiving feedback on my progress towards those goals.  
      </p>
      <h3>6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        I expect myself to be dedicated and committed to learning and making progress in the program. 
        This includes being proactive in seeking help when needed, collaborating effectively with others, and being open to feedback and constructive criticism. 
        I also expect myself to take ownership of my learning journey and be accountable for my own progress.
        I am committed to managing my workload in a productive and safe manner. This includes setting realistic goals and deadlines for myself, prioritising tasks based on their importance and urgency, and communicating effectively with others in the program. 
        I will also make sure to take breaks and practice self-care to avoid burnout. 
        Finally, I will be respectful and inclusive of others in the program, and strive to create a positive and collaborative learning environment.
      </p>

    <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3>
      1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
    </h3>
    <p>
     My long term career goal is to be working within the animal welfare industry in some way, to improve the laws surrounding animal welfare, within New Zealand.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      My strengths are that I am hard working and resilient. My limitations are that I can be quite critical of myself and I can find it hard to manage my stress.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
  <p>
 I definitely am mostly used to face to face interactions with people and it can be quite intimidating messaging a large amount of people, so becoming more comfortable with reaching out to others online is a skill I would like to develop whilst at Dev Academy.
  </p>
 <h3>
  4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you and An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
 </h3>   
 <p>
 I love routines and so I have planned one out to follow during this course.
 I do need to reach out more often, especially when it is starting to feel overwhelming. I need to remind myself that most people here are beginners like myself. I also need to remind myself that I won’t be able to remember and do everything all at once.
 </p>
 <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
 </h3>
 <p>
  When I have been stuck on something for more than half an hour, or when I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and just need some guidance, I will seek help.
 </p>
  <h3>
    6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
  </h3>
 <p>
 I am expecting clear communication, a supportive environment, a flexible and accommodating approach to teaching and adequate resources that will assist with my learning.
 </p>
 <h3>
  7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
 </h3>
 <p>I have no commitments at this stage except for before and after 8.30-5.30.
